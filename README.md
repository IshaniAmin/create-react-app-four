## In SongForm.js

used an uncontrolled form structure because we don't need to tie the inputs to state

## in client

make a file called .env

and in it put this:

```
REACT_APP_API = "http://localhost:3001"
```

you have access to your environment variables in create-react-app all over by doing process.env.REACT_APP_API as long as you start them off with REACT_APP_
